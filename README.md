# hangman

This is my first attempt at Javascript logic from my first month of coding, february 2019.  It uses an array of cartoon character names to run a simple game of hangman.  I used a looney tunes theme because I'm a little looney tunes.  [Play the game](https://cqyates.github.io/hangman/) to reveal the end of game image.
